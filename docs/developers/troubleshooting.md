### I can no longer push/pull to Github. What's going on?
We recently changed our organization's Github handle. You may need to update your remote's URL. For HTTPS remotes use:

```git remote set-url origin https://github.com/WildMeOrg/<your-repo-name>.git```

For SSH remotes use:

```git remote set-url origin git@github.com:WildMeOrg/<your-repo-name>.git```

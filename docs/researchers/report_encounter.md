title: Report an encounter

A picture or video gets uploaded to Wildbook, such as this one.

![animal photo](../../static/img/field_guide_1.png)

At this point, we have a MediaAsset. When the system runs the image through detection, it generates an Annotation for each animal found in the picture. This picture would be returned with two annotations, like below.

During upload, you must include a time and place where the interaction occurred; that information is paired with each of the annotations to create an Encounter. Encounters are one-to-one, meaning each encounter is an interaction with a single animal. If you interact with five members of a pack, you have five encounters.

In Wildbook, an encounter is the foundation component of the software. All entries that a user uploads are encounters. Encounters provide a reference to a time and location where an animal was spotted. 

Under the Submit menu, there are two options:

Report an encounter and [Bulk Import](/docs/researchers/bulk_import). Both options are used to submit a sighting, known in Wildbook as an encounter. Submissions include photos or video, time of sighting, and location. 

Report an encounter can be used by anyone, even users who do not have an account on the platform. 

## Submitting an encounter 

Complete the following steps to successfully submit an encounter. These fields are the minimum requirements. Any additional data provided can assist with detection and identification, but will not prevent a user from uploading their encounter.

1. Access your Wildbook homepage.
2. From the Submit menu, select Report an Encounter.
3. Under Footage, drag a file or click to add an image or video.
4. Under Date and Location, enter a date in the Encounter date field. Use an ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm).
5. Under Encounter location, provide a Location ID. If this is not available, use one of the other location reporting methods.
6. Under About You, enter your name in the Name field and email in the Email field.
7. Click Send encounter report.

Your encounter is now available as an unapproved encounter.

### Additional fields 

 - Organization: allows for an association between you, your data, and your organization
 - Project: if the picture was taken as part of a specific effort, such as a census event
 - Additional comments: any information that does not seem relevant in another field
 - Species: A list of species supported on the platform

If you are submitting as a signed-in user, you will also have the following options:

 - Status: If the animal is alive or dead

 - Sighting ID: A reference number for a collection of encounters that occurred at the same time
 - Other Email Addresses: Allows for a list of email addresses, separated by commas. The emails provided will receive updates regarding the encounter as information is added to the platform, such as resightings or association with a marked individual.

### Fields not listed 

You may see a number of fields on your Wildbook that are not listed here. Wildbook allows for some degree of customization, which means that options may be available that are specific to your Wildbook.

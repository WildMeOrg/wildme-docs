title: Bulk import (beta)
---

To allow for integration of legacy data or other large volumes of data into the platform, we have enabled a system of uploading a large amount of data all at once. This capability is called bulk import, and allows users with login privileges to provide encounter information and related metadata en masse. Because this flow is only accessible to authorized users, the encounters are uploaded as approved encounters.

_Note: this functionality is in beta. This feature can be considered largely stable. Any substantial changes will be reported out before they take place._

## How to use 

There are two pieces of set-up required to perform a bulk import: photo archive and spreadsheet. In setting up your bulk imports, ensure that each import has no more than 1000 encounters.

### Photo archive set-up

On your computer, organize the photos you'd like to upload into a single folder.

1. Create a folder.
2. Move all images you intend to upload to the folder.
3. Ensure that all file names are distinct.

If you have file names that are the same, either rename the duplicates or upload the duplicates in a separate batch.

Remember, the image names must correspond exactly to the "Encounter.MediaAsset" entries in your Wildbook Standard Format spreadsheet.

### Spreadsheet set-up

In the header of an excel or csv file, create a column for each field you want to upload to Wildbook. This must include:

1. a location reference(either Encounter.verbatimLocality, Encounter.LocationID, or Encounter.decimalLatitude and Encounter.decimalLongitude)
2. a time reference (Encounter.year, Encounter.month, Encounter.day, etc to the most granular available)
3. photograph reference (Encounter.MediaAsset)

All other fields are optional.

- Determine what columns you have data for; add and remove columns as needed.
- Fill out each line for a single encounter. If an encounter is associated with a sighting (or occurrence), include the needed information for the sighting on one line of an associated encounter.
- If leveraging any of the occurrence fields, ensure that each encounter is associated with an occurrence.occurenceID.
- Verify the following fields match exactly what exists in the system:
    -    Encounter.submitterID - this is your username
    -    Encounter.mediaAsset - this is the exact file name of each image


### Spreadsheet by use case

### Upload

When you have finished preparations, navigate to the import page (import/instructions.jsp) and begin the guided walk-through.

1. Select Upload Photos.
2. Browse to your photo directory and select Upload.
3. Select Begin Upload to be taken to the photo review page. At this point, these images are uploaded to the platform and available.
4. Review that all photos you have uploaded are available in the import. If they are, select Accept and move on.
5. Browse to your spreadsheet and select Open.
6. Select Begin Upload to be taken to the import overview.
7. Review the data integrity. _Note that the system will verify the data in the spreadsheet against ALL images you have in the system, not only the ones you are currently uploading. Review the online data integrity report carefully before initiating an upload._

If everything looks as expected, select Commit these results and confirm to import all data.

Once the import completes, you can take the following follow-up actions:

*Send to detection (no identification)*: The mediaAssets you have uploaded are sent to detection, where annotations are added for each animal the machine learning finds. Encounter metadata will be copied to each annotation. Identification can be run later individually through the Encounter page or for the entire import by accessing the appropriate log page.

*Send to identification*: The mediaAssets you have uploaded are sent through the identification process.

## Fields available

The most commonly-used fields are listed in the table below.

The follow fields can be included when uploading an encounter. Review the intent of the field and validate that it is in use in your system (meaning if you are on a terrestrial Wildbook, you will likely not leverage Encounter.depth).

## Troubleshooting

#### What formats are supported? 

.xlsx only

#### I found other fields in the database, but they don't work when I try to use them in the importer.

There are a number of additional fields that cannot be set using the Bulk Import capability.

#### I made a mistake and want to reload my encounters.

The Bulk Import capability does not validate the upload against existing data. If you choose to upload the data twice, you will create duplicate encounters.

#### I uploaded the wrong image, but when I clicked back to try again, the image was still listed.

The list displays all images uploaded. You can navigate to the image in the platform and remove it.

#### I want to set photographerX.affiliation or photographerX.fullName without providing an email address.

At present, there is no way to provide this information without providing an email address because these fields are tied into the system user management.

To work around this, you can provide an email that is used system-wide for all submissions that don't have an email associated. (ex: if you have a photograph submitted by a tourist through an external site, you can reference an email associated with the site along with the tourist's name)

This is also true for submitterX.affiliation and submitterX.fullName.

Under Silo Security, users are treated as non-collaborators, ensuring the most secure data access we offer. To ensure that data management can occur, we created the Researcher role. These are platforms members who can see and edit their own data, contribute data to the platform, and collaborate with individuals or leveraging projects.

# Getting the Researcher Role
To get the researcher role, contact either a site admin or an org-admin to create an account for you.

# Collaborating peer-to-peer
## Limited access data in organic search
While searching the platform for encounters related to your research, you may encounter encounters that are highlighted red. These are encounters you do not have access to. Click the encounter to display a prompt for collaboration with the owner of the data.
Collaboration requests share your username, email, and any optional message you want to include. To send a collaboration request, click **Yes**. Click **Cancel** to return to your results.

## Collaboration Search
1. Navigate to **Administer > My Account** and scroll down to **Collaborations**.
2. In the **Collaborations** table, you can manage your active and pending [collaborations](https://docs.wildme.org/docs/researchers/silo_security#collaborations).
3. To **Initiate New Collaboration**, use the **User Lookup** to search for a user by name or username. Optionally add a note to the recipient, then click **Initiate*.

# Collaborating through projects
Alternatively, if you want to share your data with a collection of other users, or if you want to share a subset of your data, you can use [projects](https://docs.wildme.org/docs/researchers/projects).
1. Navigate to **Administer > Manage Projects**.
2. Use the **Add Project** button to create a new project, or select from the list if you have projects that you belong to.

For projects that you own, you can add users and give them read access to the encounters in the project. They will be able to kick off and approve matches for the encounters.

##Bulk Imports
As a Researcher, you are able to upload using the bulk import functionality. You will need an org-admin or a site admin to start detection or ID on the import.

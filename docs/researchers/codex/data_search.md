## Sighting Search Bar

Look for the button that says **SIGHTINGS** on the top of the page. To search for a sighting, simply type in the location, the owner or the guid, and hit enter on your keyboard to search for sightings that match your description. 

## Explore Sightings

On the search bar, an **Explore sightings** option will show up,  when you click on it, you will be directed to the **Explore sightings** page.  There is a side menu on the left side of the page that says **Filters**, where you can input specific details about a sighting, such as region and date. 

The rest of the page displays a table of **Matching sightings**, which are recorded sightings that match your search results. On the right-hand side of the page is a cloud-shaped icon with an arrow in the center. You can click on this to download the displayed data. It will be exported in an excel document, proving a table of all the displayed information. 

By default, the **Matching sightings** table displays the columns: 

- **Time of Sighting**: shows the month, date, and year the sighting took place.
- **Region**: the location where the sighting occurred. 
- **Reporter**:  the name of the user who reported the sighting. You can click on the reporter√ïs name to visit their profile page, which shows their metadata, pending sightings, sightings, and collaborations. 
- **Creation Date**: the year, month, date, and exact time the sighting was logged.
- **Actions**: a button link you can click on to take a page containing details for each sighting. This page displays photographs, metadata, and the identification pipeline status. 

Click on the three lines icon to either check or uncheck the boxes, depending on if you want the columns displayed or not.

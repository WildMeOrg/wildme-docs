# Logging in
Your lab lead provides you with the URL to Scout and your username and password. Once you have these, open the Google Chrome web browser on your local computer and connect to Scout, entering your username and password when prompted.

**Note**: It is a best practice to log out of Scout when you have completed your work. Scout does not automatically log you out, so manually logging out is required to protect your account and work.

# Annotating your assigned tasks

If a task is assigned to you directly, and it has not been 100% annotated yet, you can click the Annotate button next to the task on the Tasks table to begin annotating randomly presented images. The annotation screen allows you to click-drag to create a bounding box and then press down arrow or begin typing to select the correct label for the annotation. In addition to the click-drag motion for creating annotations, the following tools are available to you in the annotation interface:
* zooms in on the image.
* zooms out of the image
* scroll bars for the image allow you to pan across the image looking for things to annotate
* returns to the last image annotated in this annotation session
* Done - completes annotation of this image. If any annotations were created, theyare now saved. If no annotation were created, this image no longer appears for annotation in this task, and the image is considered empty.

**Note**: If you refresh your Chrome browser, the interface presents a new random image, and your work on the image you saw before is not stored

When task annotation completes (i.e. reaches 100%), a page noting the successful completion of annotation for the task appears. Click the Tasks button on the menu to return to the Tasks view and start your next assigned task.

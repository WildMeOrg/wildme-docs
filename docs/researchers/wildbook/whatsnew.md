title: What's New in Wildbook
---

Each month, we'll provide a list of new or updated Wildbook functionality.

## 2020 Highlights

### Bulk Import
Users with the researcher role or higher can now create [bulk imports](/docs/researchers/bulk_import), allowing for up to 1000 encounters to be imported at once. Org admins or higher can manage the bulk imports as they are sent to detection and identification.

### Projects
Users can now subset their data into [projects](/docs/researchers/projects), commonly used for census or catalog management. Projects allow for the systematic application of ID to encounters, as well as for collaboration on data without users needing direct collaboration.

### Manual Annotation
As with any tool reliant on machine learning, users will occasionally need to intervene and assign a missed bounding box for an animal. This can be done from an encounter with [manual annotation](/docs/researchers/manual_annotation).

### Collaborations
For groups that want greater control over access to their data, we have silo security, which requires users to request collaborations to work with each other's data. [Collaborations](/docs/researchers/silo_security) have been upgraded to require both users to confirm the level of sharing (read vs edit).

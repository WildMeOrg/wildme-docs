## Collaborations

Silo Security only.

When you search for a user, you search by username and name. Select the desired recipient from the dropdown. You may include a message that the user will receive with the collaboration request. You cannot establish a collaboration with yourself.

You will see a list of all collaboration requests and the associated permission levels and available actions. You may need to refresh the page after selecting a button for the permission level to update.

 - invitation sent: You have sent an invitation to another user. There are no actions to be taken.
 - invited: Another user has sent an invitation to you. You can approve the invitation and grant the user view access to your data (can view), or you can deny the invitation and prevent a collaboration from being established (access denied).
 - can view (requester): Your collaboration has been accepted and you can now see all data for encounters belonging to the other user (including related sightings and individuals), and they can see yours. If you want to end the collaboration, you can Revoke View Permissions.
 - can view (receiver): You have accepted a collaboration with another user. If you want to end the collaboration, you can Revoke View Permissions. You can also choose to elevate the collaboration to allow for mutual editing if you click Grant Edit Permissions. Note that this should only be done with the other user's permission. Failure to obtain their permission may result in the other user revoking the collaboration.
 - can edit: You have elevated your collaboration with another user, so you may both edit the data for encounters belonging to the other user (including related sightings and individuals). If you want to revert to view-only permission, you can click Revoke View Permissions. If you want to end the collaboration, you can Revoke View Permissions.
 - access denied: The invitation was denied or view access was revoked. The request is retained so you have tracebility into who the collaboration was with if follow-up actions are needed or if the collaboration needs to be re-instated. To resend the invitation, click Restore Invite.
